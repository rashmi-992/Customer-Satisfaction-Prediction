# 🛍️ Customer Satisfaction Prediction using Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes Amazon product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict **customer satisfaction**. By classifying user reviews as positive, negative, the system offers insights that can help businesses better understand their customer base and improve their offerings.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict customer satisfaction using sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews.
- Apply machine learning models to classify sentiment.
- Visualize review insights and sentiment trends.
